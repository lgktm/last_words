# last_words
This is my own project which does not pursuite any goal except to practice my skills in parsing websites, working with python, data analysis and visualisation.
I scrutanised the data from "Texas department of criminal justice". Their website ( https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html) have an open API, so big thanks from me. It's main page looked pretty easy (in terms of parsing) for the newbie like me. But then I discovered that the significant part of the information is loaded in jpeg files, and that's a project for another time. Though the information about the 'last words' of the offenders is full, so I continued whith the further analysis. 
I'm not a sociologist to make any inferences based on this data, except the statistical ones, but even this is impossible now due to lack of some information.

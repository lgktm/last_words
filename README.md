This is my own project which does not pursuite any goal except to practice my skills in parsing websites, working with python, data analysis and visualisation.

I scrutanised the data from "Texas department of criminal justice". Their website ( https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html) have an open API, so big thanks from me.

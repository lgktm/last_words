# Last Words project
This is my own project which does not pursuite any goal except to practice my skills in parsing websites, working with python, data analysis and visualisation.

I scrutinysed the data from the "Texas department of criminal justice". Their website ( https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html) have an open API, so big thanks from me. They provide the information about executed offensers in Texas from 1982, their demographic data and the Last Words offenders said before the execution. Based on that data I've built the Word cloud and some other stats.
